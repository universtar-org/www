Before requesting an institution, please check the [university list](/#university-list) and ensure the institution does not exist in the list.

To request adding an institution, you need to [open an issue](https://github.com/universtar-org/universtar/issues/new?template=instituion-request.md) and complete the list by providing relevant information about the institution.
